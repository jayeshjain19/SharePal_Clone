Used Libraries to create this clone:

1.Styled Components: Used to avoid external CSS File.And Create CSS directly in JSX file.
2.Material-UI: Used to add icons in the clone webite
3.ImgBB : This is not a library. I used this website to host image and create image hosting link.

Steps Taken To create this Website:

1. Created a Page Folder to create different pages and add components to it.(In this case this is single page clone so no extra page was created.)
2. Created Components Folder To Add Different Components To Pages Like NavBar, Promotion, Products, Footer.
3. I also tried to make this website Responsive So YOu can try to open this Clone Website on Mobile Devices.

I hope the recruiters like the project. If you have any suggestion for me feel to email me on my email-id as I have already mentioned it on my Resume.

Thank You
